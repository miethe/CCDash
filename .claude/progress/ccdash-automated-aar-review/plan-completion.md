# Plan-Level Completion Report — CCDash Automated AAR Review Loop (v1)

**Plan:** `docs/project_plans/implementation_plans/features/ccdash-automated-aar-review-v1.md`
**Tier:** 3 · **Branch:** `feat/ccdash-automated-aar-review` · **Completed:** 2026-07-23
**Directive:** `/dev:execute-plan … squash to main when done` — auto-merge override honored.

## Outcome

The shipped P1 deterministic AAR→session triage MVP is now a persisted, fully-evidenced,
LAN-consumable review loop with a gated, default-off autonomous worker. All 7 phases completed;
every phase-exit gate and the end-of-feature reviewer gate passed. The 4 hard invariants held
throughout and were independently verified (AST/grep audits): **(#1)** zero LLM/model calls on the
compute path; **(#2)** CCDash emits only — no ARC/swarm dispatch, no SkillMeat/skill/agent mutation;
**(#3)** no new CorePort (reuse only); **(#4)** all session-derived strings originate from the
redaction-passed `session_detail` bundle, never raw JSONL.

## Per-phase summary

| Phase | Deliverable | Isolation | Interim reviewer |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | Verdict DTO reconciliation (nested `correlation`, 3-value verdict, schema v2) + `aar_reviews` persistence (dual-DDL v42, ADR-007) + idempotent backfill | none | task-completion-validator — APPROVED |
| P2 | Four foundational flags enriched with plan/task + `session_detail` evidence from entity links | none | task-completion-validator — APPROVED |
| P3 | 5th flag `new_skill_or_agent_need` + read-only SkillMeat ranking evidence link | none | task-completion-validator — APPROVED |
| P4 | Read surfaces — v1 LAN endpoint + `aar-review` capability + FE panel (built/tested) | none | task-completion-validator APPROVED · karen SC-7 MET-WITH-CAVEATS |
| P5 | Cross-repo op consumer contract (D5 = PULL) + non-auto-route smoke assertion | none | task-completion-validator — APPROVED (after fix) |
| P6 | Gated writeback seam (dormant) + default-off autonomous worker + 3 self-recursion guards | none | task-completion-validator APPROVED · karen SC-5 MET-WITH-CAVEATS |
| P7 | Docs finalization (CHANGELOG/README/CLAUDE.md/operator guide) + 3 deferred-items specs | none | task-completion-validator SC-9 APPROVED · karen SC-10 COMPLETE-WITH-CAVEATS |

## Reviewer verdict (end-of-feature, SC-10)

karen: **COMPLETE-WITH-CAVEATS — SAFE TO MERGE: YES — hard pre-merge blockers: NONE.**

## Locked architectural decisions (orchestrator)

- **OQ-2:** `correlation.confidence` gates the verdict, not the correlation *strategy*.
- **D5 = PULL:** op consumes via the existing REST/MCP/CLI pull path; PUSH promotion is spec'd
  with an explicit trigger condition (`aar-review-event-transport-promotion.md`) but not built.
- **OQ-4:** per-project escalation quota `5 / 24h` — one project can never starve another.
- **Guard 1 fail-closed:** a session whose provenance row is missing/unfetchable is EXCLUDED from
  triage input (a self-recursion guard must fail closed).

## Verification totals

- 185+ backend tests + 20 FE vitest — green.
- 7/7 phase-exit gates clean (0 violations); plan AC dry-check clean (0 vague ACs).
- Runtime smoke (P4): v1 endpoint + capability live on `--runtime local`; `runtime_smoke: partial`
  (no browser automation + no persisted rows in dev DB — honest per the gate).

## Honest caveats (not blockers)

1. ~~FE panel not yet mounted~~ **RESOLVED (2026-07-23 follow-up)**: `FeatureAARReviewPanel` is now
   mounted as a feature-scoped "AAR Review" lazy tab in `FeatureDetailShell` (filters to the
   feature's `correlation.feature_id`); 23/23 vitest.
2. ~~Live persistence requires the default-off worker~~ **RESOLVED (2026-07-23 follow-up)**: the
   sweep worker is now **default-on** (worker-profile-gated) and fans out over **every registered
   project** per tick (`_resolve_projects_to_sweep` → `workspace_registry.list_projects()`), with
   per-project `workspace_id` resolution replacing the `default-local` hardcode. Verified: the LAN
   node runs a dedicated `ccdash_worker` (profile `worker`) container that schedules the sweep;
   `worker-watch` correctly does not (no double-run). Delivered to the nuc via `/redeploy` (pure
   code — config default + FE build; no env edits). task-completion-validator: **APPROVED**.
3. **Writeback seam is dormant** (no production caller) — safest state. Unchanged.

### Residuals after the 2026-07-23 follow-up
- **Multi-*workspace* (not multi-project)**: `aar_review.py`'s own session lookups still use the
  `default-local` workspace, so projects on a non-default workspace aren't fully supported
  end-to-end. Guard 1 stays fail-closed → worst case "triages nothing," never a wrong write. The
  common single-workspace/multi-project node (the nuc) is correct.
- **PG operability smoke not run in this environment** (no Docker here). No new DDL was added (the
  `aar_reviews` table shipped at v42 in P1) and the multi-project fan-out reuses the already-
  PG-proven `workspace_registry.list_projects()` helper, so risk is low — but verify the
  `ccdash_worker` container's sweep logs on the nuc after `/redeploy`, or run
  `npm run docker:hosted:smoke:seeded-pg` on a Docker host.

## Pre-production checklist (before flipping `CCDASH_AAR_REVIEW_AUTONOMOUS_WORKER_ENABLED`)

1. Resolve the worker's `workspace_id="default-local"` hardcode for multi-workspace/LAN (Guard 1
   depends on a real session fetch; fail-closed keeps it SAFE but a broken fetch triages nothing).
2. When the dormant writeback seam is wired: build `ApprovedRunReference` only from a real
   op-approve run AND always pass real `escalation_history` (test that empty history is rejected).
3. Runtime/integration test that `aclear_project_cache` actually evicts `aar_review_list` after a
   live sweep.
4. Seeded-PG smoke with the worker flag ON in staging before any production flip.
5. Decide coalescing-guard posture (per-instance vs shared).

## Deferred-items design specs (P7 DOC-006)

- `docs/project_plans/design-specs/op-story-session-ref-frontmatter-contract.md` (OQ-3/OQ-6)
- `docs/project_plans/design-specs/aar-review-escalation-quota-tuning.md` (OQ-4)
- `docs/project_plans/design-specs/aar-review-event-transport-promotion.md` (D5 → PUSH trigger)

## Durable lesson

Doc sub-agents fabricated feature details in three separate deliverables (API surfaces, flag
names, a verdict value + schema version + dedup key). Every doc artifact needed a
verbatim-against-source correction. Treat doc-agent output as unverified until diffed against the
real shipped shapes.

## Landing

Squash-merged to `main` (see plan frontmatter `merge_commit` / `merge_branch`, set post-merge).
Individual phase SHAs (P1–P7) recorded in `commit_refs` are work-history pointers on the (deleted)
feature branch; `merge_commit` is the canonical landing pointer.
