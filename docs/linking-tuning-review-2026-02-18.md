# Mapping Tuning Review Pack (Docs <> Features <> Sessions)

Date: 2026-02-18

How to review:
- Fill `Your Verdict` with one of: `KEEP`, `NOISE`, `UNCERTAIN`.
- Add short rationale in `Your Notes` when useful (especially for edge cases).
- Prioritize rows where `Heuristic` is `LIKELY_NOISE` but you think it is actually valuable.

Selected feature sample set:
- `marketplace-source-detection-improvements-v1`
- `artifact-metadata-cache-v1`
- `marketplace-sources-enhancement-v1`
- `multi-platform-project-deployments-v1`
- `collection-data-consistency-v1`

## Sample Stats

- Total review rows: `117`
- Doc->Feature: `57`
- Session->Feature: `60`
- Heuristic LIKELY_VALID: `38`
- Heuristic LIKELY_NOISE: `70`
- Heuristic UNCERTAIN: `9`
